Machine Learning allows you to use data to forecast the future without writing a program.

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Model is the program that can be used to recognize the pattern in the data.
Model can be used to predict the future behaviors  ->  ex: Traffic lights
Model can be used to categorize something as one thing or another -> ex: Bike/car/cycle
Model can be used to recognize the people ,objects and landmarks using unseen images
Model can be used to understand the context of natural human text or speech
Once a model has been deployed , it can recognise patterns in the data it has never seen before 

Machine Learning Types
--------------------------
1)Regression- its type of supervised learning
The model learns from labeled data (input + correct output).
Examples:

Email spam detection (spam / not spam)
Predicting house prices
Image classification (cat / dog)

2)Clustering -Unsupervised Learning
The model learns patterns from unlabeled data (no correct answers).

Examples:

Customer grouping (clustering)
Anomaly detection
Data compression

Deep Learning
--------------
Its subtype of machine learning and it uses deep neural networks to handle complex tasks like images, speech, and text.

DataSet Features and Labels
-------------------------
Features are the input Variable
Label is the thing we are predicting
