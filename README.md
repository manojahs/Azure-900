Machine Learning allows you to use data to forecast the future without writing a program.

Model is the program that can be used to recognize the pattern in the data.
Model can be used to predict the future behaviors  ->  ex: Traffic lights
Model can be used to categorize something as one thing or another -> ex: Bike/car/cycle
Model can be used to recognize the people ,objects and landmarks using unseen images
Model can be used to understand the context of natural human text or speech
Once a model has been deployed , it can recognise patterns in the data it has never seen before
