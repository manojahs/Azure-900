```
Machine Learning allows you to use data to forecast the future without writing a program.

Machine Learning (ML) is a field of artificial intelligence (AI) that allows computers to learn patterns from data and make decisions or predictions without being explicitly programmed.

Model is the program that can be used to recognize the pattern in the data.
Model can be used to predict the future behaviors  ->  ex: Traffic lights
Model can be used to categorize something as one thing or another -> ex: Bike/car/cycle
Model can be used to recognize the people ,objects and landmarks using unseen images
Model can be used to understand the context of natural human text or speech
Once a model has been deployed , it can recognise patterns in the data it has never seen before 

Machine Learning Types
--------------------------
1)Regression- its type of supervised learning
The model learns from labeled data (input + correct output).
Examples:

Email spam detection (spam / not spam)
Predicting house prices
Image classification (cat / dog)

2)Clustering -Unsupervised Learning
The model learns patterns from unlabeled data (no correct answers).

Examples:

Customer grouping (clustering)
Anomaly detection
Data compression

Deep Learning
--------------
Its subtype of machine learning and it uses deep neural networks to handle complex tasks like images, speech, and text.

DataSet Features and Labels
-------------------------
Features are the input Variable
Label is the thing we are predicting
  

1)Azure Auto ML
2)Azure ML Designer
      no code approach to model design
      Drag the dataset into the designer Canvas
      Visualize the data
      Exclude the column that are not going to be useful for training
      Clean rows with missing data from Training
      Normalize the data to make more useful through transformation
3)Azure Vision Workloads
    - Azure AI vision/ Azure AI Services(Cognitive Services)
    - It includes many other services in one umbrella.

All Azure services require a key and an Endpoint.

Azure AI custom Vision
-----------------------
This custom vision services seperates out Traning and Prediction into 2 Resources 

Natural language Processing
----------------------------
NLP workload scenario

- Understand written and spoken language
- Key phrase extranction
- Entity Recognition
- Sentiment Analysis
- Language Modeling
- Speech recognition and Synthesis
- Translation 

Azure AI speeach service
Azure AI Translator service

Generative AI Solutions
------------------------------
Generative AI is a type of artificial intelligence that can create new content — such as images, text, videos, code, music, and more — by learning patterns from existing data.
Ex: Chatgpt

Common Scenario of Use cases
1) Image Generation
   - Art Creation
   - Face Generation

2) Text Generation
   - Chatbot agents
   - Content creation
   - Code Generation

3) Music/Audio Generation
   - Music comp
   - Voice Synthesis
   - Sound Effect

4) Video Generation
   - Deep Fakes
   - Animation
   - Improving the quality of video footage

Responsible Generative AI
-----------------------------
There are clearly dangers of Generative AI:
 - Ability to create fake news
 - fake voice
 - illegal activities
 

So Why Do Both DL and Generative AI Produce Images?
✔ Deep Learning = the technology

(neural networks)
✔ Generative AI = the purpose

(create new content)

Generative AI uses Deep Learning models
to generate images.

You can think of it like this:

DL = Engine
Generative AI = Car that uses the engine to create something new
Without Deep Learning, Generative AI cannot create images.

Natural Lanaguage Generation (NLG)
-----------------------------
NLG is subfield of AI and It focused on creating text and it mimics the human language

It enables AI models to generate contextually appropriate responses based on input data/prompts

Azure openAI Service
---------------
Azure OpenAI provides access to models like GPT-4, GPT-4o, GPT-3.5, etc., which are primarily designed for:
Generating natural language (text, answers, summaries)
Understanding and producing human-like responses
Conversational AI
Content creation

Capabilities of azure openAI for NLG
- Content Generation
- Text summarization
- Conversational Agents
- Code Generation
- Translation
- Creative Writing

Code Generation
-------------
Ex: Codex it helps to generate the code across multiple programming language.
